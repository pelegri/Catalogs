__*EXPERIMENTAL*__ - This page explores one approach to combine
information on onDevice, Official and Community components in a single place
so they are easy to search.

This page contains several tables covering all components known to work with BlackBerry 10 devices,
generated from a [JSON file](All_Components.json).
Also see [All Repos] and [All Samples].

<p>
There are <span style='font-size:140%;' id='stats-compCount'><!-- dynamic content --></span> components.
</p>

Components are classified as being
[OnDevice](#onDevice) (and white-listed, thus being useable),
[Official](#official)
and
[Community](#community).
The OnDevice and Official ports are also listed in the
[BlackBerry NDK microsite](http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/library_support_at_a_glance.html), which also includes many non-Open Source libraries.


The table uses the following tooltips:
<span class="question" tip="(Repo column) A list of 'tags' characterizing this repo (useful?)">T</span>, 
<span class="question" tip="(Desc column) Extra details on the repository">?</span>,
and
<span class="warning" tip="(Desc column) Issues to resolve">!</span>,
